# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-DATA-SCIENCE-2022-

The study hereby presented concerns the topic of demand forecasting, and the case study at hand entails the industry of bike sharing for the city during a time span of one year (between 2017 and 2018) in Seoul (South Korea).
Data is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

This project aims at assessing to which extent it is possible to predict the demand for bikes given the data at hand in order, ultimately, to provide some additional insights on the public sharing industry.
For the sake of clearness, the target variable will be called "Rented.Bike.Count", and it is inherently a non-negative continuous variable.
